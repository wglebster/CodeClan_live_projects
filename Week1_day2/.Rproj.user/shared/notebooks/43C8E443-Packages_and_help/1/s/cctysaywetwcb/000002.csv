"1"," ""My Hobby: Extrapolating\n[[There is a graph.  Time runs along the horizontal axis; Number of Husbands on the vertical graph.  Yesterday and today are labeled in time, 0 and 1 in number of husbands.  Points are plotted with 0 at yesterday, 1 at today.  A straight line is fitted through them.]]\n[[A man is holding a pointer to the graph, and looking at a woman wearing a dress and veil.]]\nMan: As you can see, by late next month you'll have over four dozen husbands. Better get a bulk rate on wedding cake.\n\n{{Title text: By the third trimester, there will be hundreds of babies inside you.}}"""
