I created database wrestling using terminal command "createdb wrestling", then seed it using script "psql -d wrestling -f wrestling.sql" and to check that it has worked correctly, I run "psql -d wrestling -f db_query.sql". The file db_query.sql has the following script inside: "SELECT * FROM wrestlers. 
------------
Create a connection to the local wrestling database from R.
Pass the argument max.con = 2 to PostgreSQL() to make sure you don’t have too many simultaneous connections. We’ll be setting up a local connection and perhaps a remote connection, hence ‘2’.
Remember to add a separate ‘disconnect’ block of code. We’ll write queries between the ‘connect’ and ‘disconnect’ blocks.

```{r}
library(RPostgreSQL) #import psql library
credentials_location <- paste0(Sys.getenv("HOME"),"/credentials.R") #get file path to credentials.
source(credentials_location) #source in credentials
```
```{r}
#create db connection
wrestling_db_connection <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(max.con = 2), user = postgresql_username, password = postgresql_password, dbname = 'wrestling', host = 'localhost')
```
